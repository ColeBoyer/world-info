World-Info

World Info's goal is to be a repository of information about your Minecraft world.  For single-player, World Info can detail the progress of your survival builds.  For multi-player, World Info can act as a collaborative hub for projects and events.

World-Info is built with UV.  [Check out UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

To run the demo site, use the following:
uv run flask run

I'm currently just ripping everything from the fantastic tutorial by Miguel Grinberg [The Flask Mega-Tutorial.](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)  Please check him out, buy his book, etc.
